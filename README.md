## Python app for the generation of Digit images with Evolutionary algorithms.
The penalty function used is a ML algorithm trained on the MNIST dataset. 

The starting point of the iterations is an image generated with random pixels and the end result is an image ressembling a number to be specified before starting the loop.

The python framework used for this genetic programming task is [DEAP](https://deap.readthedocs.io/en/master/).
